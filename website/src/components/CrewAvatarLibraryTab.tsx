/**
 * The avatar builder's Library pane — pick, import or delete an appearance pack.
 *
 * A pack is art somebody else drew: the crew record names it by id and the
 * server serves each state's frame, so the whole of "wearing a pack" is one
 * string. That is why this pane holds no draft the way the ghost and picture
 * panes do — clicking a card is the edit, and Apply commits the id.
 *
 * The grid reads each card's thumbnail through the PER-SLOT route rather than
 * the pack detail route. Detail inlines every file in the pack, so a grid of N
 * cards would load N whole packs to draw N frames.
 *
 * Only SVG packs are selectable. That is a rendering fact, not a policy: a
 * crew's face is an `<img>` and core ships no Lottie or sprite player, so a pack
 * in either format lists greyed with a note. Hiding it instead would read as the
 * import having failed.
 *
 * The list is re-read on every open rather than cached. Import and delete both
 * change it, and a stale grid here shows a pack that is gone or hides one the
 * user just installed — the two mistakes this pane must not make.
