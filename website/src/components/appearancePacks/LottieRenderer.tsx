/**
 * LottieRenderer — renders Lottie JSON animations via lottie-web.
 * Manages animation lifecycle: destroys old animation and loads new
 * when animationData changes. Notifies parent via onReady callback.
 *
 * Core, not app-owned: a crew can wear an appearance pack whose art is a Lottie
 * document, so the dashboard's own avatar needs this player while Crew
 * Companion — an optional app — may be absent. Core never imports from
 * `apps/`, so the player lives here and the Companion reads it from core.

/*
 * The LIGHT player, deliberately.
 *
 * `lottie-web`'s default build evaluates animation expressions, and the JSON reaching
 * `loadAnimation` here is attacker-authored: an appearance pack imported from a
 * third-party gallery carries its own `.json`, and it runs in the gateway's origin.
 * Nothing that draws a pack needs expressions, so the smaller player removes the sink
 * rather than trying to sanitise it.
 *
 * The light build closes expressions ONLY. It still resolves a document's `assets`
 * and `fonts` by requesting them, so `referencesRemoteAsset` refuses such a clip
 * below — the light player is half the fence, not the whole of it.
