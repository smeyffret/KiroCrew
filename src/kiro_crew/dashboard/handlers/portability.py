#: already governs this path: `portability._MAX_IMPORT_UNCOMPRESSED` admits 2 GiB
#: *uncompressed*, so a compressed archive under 2 GiB cannot be refused here
#: without the two limits contradicting each other.
#:
#: A tighter ceiling (512 MB, say) is a NEW restriction rather than a restored
#: one -- the upload streams to disk, so nothing downstream needs it -- and it
#: would 413 a legitimate export exactly when the source machine may be gone.
#: The cap exists only so an unbounded upload cannot fill the disk, and 2 GiB is
#: the largest value consistent with the guard downstream.
