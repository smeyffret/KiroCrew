"""Claude Code's agent-config mirror (``claude-agent-acp``).

The only backend that needs BOTH faces:

* **Wire** — MCP servers arrive as the ``mcpServers`` parameter of
  ``session/new`` / ``session/load``. The adapter reads no agent file, so that
  array is the session's entire MCP surface: empty means the harness works and
  every Crew tool is absent, with no error.
* **File** — ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json``, which the adapter loads
  itself, carries the model allowlist, the resolved model, the permission mode
  and the deny rules derived from ``disabledTools``.

The translation itself lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp` (spec entry ->
array element, ``tools`` allowlist, registry filter) and in ``AcpClient``'s
settings writer. This module is the mirror: it declares what happens to every
concern and routes the two faces. That split matches KAS, where
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_permissions` stays beside the mirror as its translation
helper rather than being inlined into it.

        """The wire face: the ``mcpServers`` array for this session.

        ``stub_server_names`` are the pooled broker stubs the caller appends
        separately, and they must be excluded here rather than translated: a stub
        wraps — and is keyed by — the same name as the agent-spec entry it rewrites,
        so translating both halves would put two elements with one ``name`` into a
        single array. Either the raw entry shadows the stub and the session bypasses
        the broker, or both register and every pooled backend runs twice.

        **``permission_surface_owned`` is a precondition, not an option, and it
        defaults to withholding.** Crew's gate fires on
        ``session/request_permission``; a tool pre-approved in ``permissions.allow``
        never sends one, so Crew sees the ``tool_call`` notification only after the
        fact and cannot withhold it. The seed Crew authors carries
        ``defaultMode`` plus the spec's ``permissions.deny``, which is what puts a
        session under the gate — but the writer is create-or-decline, so a project
        that already has its own ``settings.local.json`` gets no seed and Crew
        governs nothing there. Handing THAT session the array would deliver
        ``spawn_run``, ``cron_add``, ``send_message`` and every configured server
        into a permission surface Crew does not control.

        So the array is withheld unless Crew governs the file -- authored it
        this session, or verified byte-for-byte that it is a sibling Crew
        session's live seed identical to what this session would have written
        (the caller's ``_permission_surface_governed``). The cost is
        stated rather than hidden: a session where neither holds runs with no
        Crew MCP tools, which is exactly how every claude session behaved before
        this array existed, so nothing regresses — it simply does not gain tools
        Crew could not take back.

        ``work_dir`` is the session's project checkout, and it is required for
        CORRECTNESS rather than convenience: kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against
        ``<work_dir>/.kiro/agents`` as well as the user level, so omitting it makes a
        project-only agent read as "no spec" and drops the ``tools`` allowlist that
        spec declared. A mirror cannot discover the checkout on its own, so the
        caller passes it.

        Blocking — it reads the agent spec. The caller warms this on the spawn path
        and serves the shared ``session/new`` call site from that cache (H13). The
        client calls :meth:`session_projection`; this method IS that projection's
        ``params``, so the two faces cannot drift.

        The shared gateway's broker stubs are placed HERE rather than by the
        client's shared append, for the reason codex already placed its own: the
        two withhold rules this mirror applies must cover BOTH halves of the
        array, and an append the mirror never sees bypasses them.

        * **The permission-surface precondition covers the stubs.** A stub is a
          working server (``spawn_run``, ``cron_add``, every pooled backend), so
          appending it after :meth:`session_params` withheld the translated half
          would hand an ungoverned permission surface exactly the tools the
          withhold exists to keep off it.
        * **The spec's ``tools`` allowlist covers the stubs.** The gateway
          overlay is written per agent from the GLOBAL settings file as well as
          the agent's own spec, so it can carry a stub for a server this agent's
          ``tools`` never references -- and a stub is that server, under the same
          name. The translated half was filtered by that allowlist; the stubs
          are held to the same one, from the same parse, or the unreferenced
          server mounts anyway the moment the gateway pools it.

        A stub for a server the spec narrows per tool stays MOUNTED here, unlike
        codex: the narrowing rides ``permissions.deny`` in ``settings.local.json``
        (``mcp__<server>__<tool>``), which matches the stub because the stub
        registers under the same server name. Withholding it would drop a server
        this backend can narrow correctly.

        ``denied_tools`` stays empty: the deny channel is the settings file, not
        a client-side refusal. ``kwargs`` may carry ``session_key`` /
        ``channel_id``, which this backend ignores -- a claude MCP child inherits
        the adapter's process env, so identity needs no element-level carry.
