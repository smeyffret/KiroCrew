"""Durable provenance for the ``settings.local.json`` seed Crew writes.

Crew seeds ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json`` for a claude-agent-acp
session and overwrites or removes ONLY the file it owns. Proving that ownership
from per-instance memory alone ("this client created it" plus "the bytes it
wrote") answers the question correctly inside one session and wrongly outside
one: a seed left behind by a session that was killed, or by an earlier app
version, reads as a stranger's file forever after. The writer then
takes its leave-it-alone branch on every subsequent session, so a stale
``availableModels`` allowlist (and a stale ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an
inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes permanent project state that Crew can
neither refresh nor clean up.

This module is the missing half: a small record, under Crew's OWN data home, of
the bytes Crew last wrote to a given settings path. It is a **provenance
credential, not a permission grant** — a record alone proves nothing, because
adoption additionally requires the file on disk to still hash to the recorded
digest. A user-authored file (or a Crew file the user has since edited) never
matches, so it is still left untouched; only Crew's own orphan is recognized and
re-seeded.

Four properties the callers depend on:

* **Nothing is added to the user's project.** The record lives beside Crew's
  other sidecars in ``config_dir()``, keyed by the settings path, so a checked-out
  repository gains no extra file to notice, ignore or commit.
* **Lookups never touch the disk, and no mutation runs on the event loop.**
  Ownership is consulted synchronously from teardown, so the sidecar is read once
  at import and served from memory afterwards. Both MUTATIONS (:func:`record` and
  :func:`forget`) write and are therefore blocking; each has an off-loop caller,
  and :func:`forget` is awaited through a thread rather than called from the loop.
  :func:`release` is the in-memory-only counterpart that teardown may call
  directly.
* **Every failure answers "not ours".** An unreadable or corrupt sidecar, a
  missing entry, a malformed entry — all degrade to the pre-existing behaviour of
  leaving the file alone, which is the safe direction.
* **A record is adoptable only once nobody here still holds it.** Ownership is
  scoped to an owner token, so an orphan is adopted by the next session while a
  path a LIVE client in this process is seeding stays that client's own.

    failure instead of only logging it.

    **Reload-merge-publish under the cross-process lock.** The sidecar is shared by
    every Crew process on the host, and ``atomic_write`` renaming a new inode over it
    makes the LAST writer win outright. So this reloads the on-disk seeds INSIDE
    :func:`_cross_process_lock`, overlays this process's own ``_RECORDS``, and
    publishes the union — a concurrent process's records are preserved rather than
    dropped. This process's entries win for any key it holds; keys present only on
    disk belong to another live process and are kept untouched. Reloading a sibling's
    key into what is published does NOT make this process treat it as adoptable: only
    ``_RECORDS`` (never refreshed from disk here) feeds :func:`recorded`, so a live
    sibling's seed still reads as absent — "not ours" — to this process.

    *drop* removes the key a :func:`forget` just revoked. Without it the merge would
    resurrect that key from the copy still on disk, and the revoke would never stick.

    *pending* is the entry a :func:`record` is trying to make durable, supplied as an
    argument instead of being read from ``_RECORDS``: the module's lock-free readers
    (:func:`share`, :func:`recorded`) see ``_RECORDS`` at any instant, and an entry
    published there before this write lands would let a sibling validate a share
    against a grant that then fails to persist -- a governed reader whose file no
    later session can recognize. So the caller publishes to ``_RECORDS`` only after
    this returns ``True``, and a failing persist leaves nothing for a reader to see.

    There is exactly ONE prune, and it runs unconditionally: entries whose file is
    gone. Nothing is left at those paths to overwrite, adopt or clean up, so they are
    pure growth. *keep* exempts the key the current transaction just wrote, so the
    entry a :func:`record` has this moment created is authoritative even if the caller
    has not put a file there. Without it a record would depend on a stat of a path the
    module does not own the writing of, and "record then look it up" -- the one
    invariant every caller leans on -- would answer differently depending on how the
    caller sequenced its own write.

    There is deliberately no entry CAP on top of that. A cap can only evict entries
    whose file still exists, and those are precisely the adoptable orphans this module
    exists to keep: evicting one makes its path unrecorded, so its own owner can no
    longer recognize it and no later session is permitted to repair it either —
    whatever the file holds (a stale ``availableModels``, a stale
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes
    permanent project state. That is the exact failure this module removes, so a cap
    would re-manufacture it for the oldest work dir. Growth is already bounded by the
    prune above: the sidecar cannot outgrow the set of seeds actually on disk.

    not an orphan, and re-seeding it would overwrite that session's permission
    mode and delete its file on this client's reset.

    In-memory only, so this is safe to call from the event loop — and deliberately
    LOCK-FREE for the same reason: :data:`_LOCK` is held across the sidecar write,
    so taking it here would let a worker's disk I/O stall the one loop. Each
    statement below is a single dict read, which is atomic under CPython, so a
    concurrent :func:`record` can only make this return the older or the newer
    entry, never a torn one. The size is returned alongside the digest so a caller
    can reject a mismatched file without reading it, and bound its read to exactly
    the bytes it will hash.

    **BLOCKING — callers must run this off the event loop** (``asyncio.to_thread``
    or an executor). It takes :data:`_LOCK` and writes the sidecar.

    The return value is the contract, and it is what makes the revoke safe to
    delete a file behind: ``True`` means the sidecar on disk no longer names
    *path*, so the caller may unlink. Dropping the entry from memory alone would
    leave the sidecar naming a path Crew has just deleted, and the digest check
    does not make that inert -- the next process reloads the entry, and any file
    that hashes to it (most plainly the very seed a user committed to the
    repository and then restored) is adopted, overwritten with this install's
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, and unlinked on reset. So the grant has to die
    with the file it described, and it has to die FIRST.

    ``False`` is returned in the two cases where the caller must keep the file:

    * a DIFFERENT owner holds the path live, so a client that could not adopt a
      sibling's seed cannot revoke the sibling's claim either; and
    * the sidecar write failed, in which case the entry is put BACK in memory so
      this process agrees with what a restart would read, and the grant is simply
      not revoked yet. The file stays, the record stays, and a later session
      recognizes the orphan and repairs it -- which is strictly better than a
      deletion whose revocation never reached the disk.
