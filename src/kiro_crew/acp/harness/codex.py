"""The Codex ACP adapter: one Node process, N sessions, and its own confinement.

``@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`` is a Node stdio server. It boots a single
``codex app-server`` child and translates ACP onto that server's operations. The
``codex`` CLI does not serve ACP itself -- it reads ``acp`` as a prompt -- so the
adapter is the transport, not an optimization.

**One process already hosts many sessions, which is why this harness exists.** The
adapter keeps ``this.sessions = new Map()`` and each ACP session id is a Codex
thread id on the one shared ``codex app-server`` child. N Crew sessions on one
adapter is therefore the adapter's own design, not something Crew layers on top.
:class:`~kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient` starts one adapter per session and pays N
Node processes and N app-servers for N sessions; ``AcpRuntime`` pays one.

**One thing is global on a shared process, and a caller has to know it.**
``providers/set`` restarts the ``codex app-server`` child and then re-resumes every
thread on it. On a per-session adapter that is one user's session. Here it is EVERY
session on the process. Nothing in this module sends ``providers/set``, and nothing
should start sending it per session.

Codex is confined by Crew's sandbox and by nothing else
------------------------------------------------------
``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`` does not name codex, so :attr:`internal_sandbox`
is False and Crew's own seatbelt/bubblewrap wrapper is the only OS confinement a
codex session gets. The Codex sandbox modes the adapter can apply are in-process
policy, not an OS sandbox Crew's could nest inside.

Crew's tool gate ENFORCES codex, so the spawn carries a credential mask on its
``SpawnPlan``. For an enforced host that mask is the only thing between a
third-party binary and the operator's credential homes: ACP cannot make such a host
ask about a passive read.

Two tiers hand back an UNWRAPPED child and drop that mask on the floor -- ``off``,
and a host with no sandbox backend where unsandboxed exec is opted in. An enforced
host that spawned there would run a third-party binary with the operator's credential
homes readable and nothing compensating for it, so :func:`resolve_spawn_masks`
REFUSES those tiers instead of returning an empty mask.

Permission routing is asserted per session, not seeded to a file
----------------------------------------------------------------
codex-acp's default ``agent`` mode writes inside the workspace without asking. Its
ACP v1 ``mode`` selector is the enforceable boundary, written over
``session/set_config_option`` -- ``Routing.SESSION_CONFIG`` in
``ACP_BACKEND_ROUTING``, which both drivers read for themselves. This harness
declares no routing member: a second copy of that table would be free to disagree
with the one that decides. There is no settings file to author first either, which
is why this harness has no ordering constraint the claude one has. ``read-only``
still permits passive READS; ACP v1 has no way to require a prompt for those, and
what makes the residual gap survivable is that mask.

The session array is the whole tool surface, so it is NARROWED
--------------------------------------------------------------
codex reads no agent spec, so ``session/new``'s ``mcpServers`` is everything the
session will ever have -- and one element whose transport the adapter never
advertised fails the WHOLE request with ``-32600``, taking every other server with
it. :meth:`CodexHarness.session_mcp_servers` is where that is narrowed, against the
capabilities THIS session's handshake reported.

Empty capabilities mean "nothing is known", never "nothing is supported": on a
handshake that advertised none, the array passes through untouched. Narrowing to
nothing there would strip every tool from every session.

The recycle ceiling is an open measurement, deliberately not a guess
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Seam 9 is inherited unchanged, so the operator's configured thresholds are the
whole answer today. That is the honest state rather than the right one: the runtime
default was chosen for kiro-cli, where the growth is in one child, and a codex
process holds N sessions plus a shared ``codex app-server`` that serves every
thread. The floor is higher and the growth is shared, so the same ceiling recycles
a merely-busy process and takes every session on it down. No number is written here
because none has been measured, and a plausible-looking constant would be worse
than the mismatch it hides.

    """``(hidden_dirs, expose_files)`` for the spawn, or a refusal.

    Two halves of one decision, resolved together and BEFORE the process exists:

    * the credential mask Crew's gate denies an enforced adapter at the OS boundary,
      and
    * the read-only files that come back through the backend's own carve-out (the
      other half of the Bedrock trade -- ``.aws`` stays hidden and only
      ``.aws/config`` returns).

    Raises when this session would spawn the adapter with its mask dropped: several
    ``wrap_argv`` paths return without applying ``extra_hidden_dirs``, and an
    enforced adapter started unmasked has no compensating control at all, so the
    refusal belongs here rather than after the spawn.

    The first half touches the filesystem (a cold sandbox probe shells out, and the
    mask canonicalizes the home plus every env-override root), so it runs in one
    worker thread with a bounded wait -- a stalled mount would otherwise hold the
    spawn open until the startup watchdog. The second half is pure path projection
    over the mask just resolved, which is why that mask is HANDED IN rather than
    re-derived: re-deriving it would put the filesystem read back on the loop.

    Keyed on the ROUTING, never on codex's identity: the preflight re-checks
    ``acp_tool_gate.is_enforced`` itself, so this cannot mask a harness this core
    does not enforce, and a future ``SESSION_CONFIG`` harness gets the same
    treatment by declaring the same routing.
