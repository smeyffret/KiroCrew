"""Per-host strategy objects for the shared-process ACP runtime.

``AcpRuntime`` hosts many sessions in one child process. What that child IS --
kiro-cli, the KAS relay, or a backend added later -- is answered here, in one
file per host, rather than by a backend test at each point of difference. There
are twelve such points, and a host that answers eleven of them is a host that
starts and then behaves like a different one.

Start at :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.harness.base`: it names every seam and says what each
one is for. :func:`harness_for` is how the runtime gets the right harness, and it
REFUSES a backend with no harness rather than serving it as kiro-cli.
