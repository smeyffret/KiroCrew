"""What an INLINE interpreter program names -- the credential-mint gate for ``-c`` and stdin.

``python -c "..."`` and the stdin forms (``python - <<'PY'``, ``echo ... | python -``,
``python < file``) run arbitrary Python with the interpreter's authority, so the
``token`` argv word cannot be the mint gate there: the payload can build the verb. What
a payload cannot avoid is NAMING the surface it reaches. This module is that question,
asked of the payload text alone: the mint surface (``_MINT_SURFACE_RE``), a product import
next to a credential word (``_PRODUCT_IMPORT_RE`` + ``_MINT_VERB_RE``), the two
static resolutions that read a hidden name back out (``_fold_inline_literals`` for
``'a' + 'b'`` pieces, ``_decoded_b64_literals`` for base64 literals), and the one
predicate the argv floor calls (``_inline_payload_reaches_cli``).

It sits below ``argv_floor`` in the dependency order and imports only the vocabulary:
the floor decides WHICH tokens are an inline program's payload; this module decides
what that payload names.

#: Dynamic-execution primitives an inline payload uses to hide WHAT it imports: string-
#: concatenated imports (``__import__('kiro_crew.c'+'li')``), name-computed imports
#: (``importlib.import_module(...)``), module runners (``runpy.run_module(...)``) and
#: second-stage decode/eval
#: (``exec(base64.b64decode(...))``). Their presence is NOT a verdict on its own -- read that
#: way, every inline ``getattr``/``eval``/``importlib`` one-liner is a credential mint, while a
#: payload that wants to hide can always do so anyway (``chr()`` arithmetic, a written-then-run
#: file -- see the residual-gap test). It is the trigger for looking HARDER:
#: ``_fold_inline_literals`` joins ``'a'+'b'`` pieces and decodes base64 literals, so the two
#: obfuscations these primitives are actually used for resolve back to the name they hide, and
#: the resolved text is what the mint-surface match reads.

#: The MINT SURFACE an inline program has to name to mint a dashboard token:
#:
#: * the CLI dispatch (``kiro_crew.cli`` / ``kiro_crew.__main__`` / the console-script entry
#:   ``kiro_crew._bootstrap``) or the module that implements the ``token`` subcommand
#:   (``kiro_crew.cli_server``) -- as an import path or as a file path fed to the interpreter
#:   (``python < src/kiro_crew/cli.py``);
#: * ``from kiro_crew import cli`` and its siblings;
#: * a product module whose path names a ``token`` producer (``kiro_crew.dashboard.token_auth``,
#:   ``kiro_crew.dashboard.token_secret``, ``kiro_crew.instances.token_mint``), as an import or a
#:   file path -- ``secret`` is deliberately NOT a path word: ``kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/
#:   secrets.py`` and ``kiro_crew/secrets/`` are ordinary modules a patch script names, and the
#:   secret READERS are covered by the import-plus-word form below;
#: * a product IMPORT STATEMENT together with a CREDENTIAL WORD -- ``token`` or ``secret`` --
#:   anywhere in the payload (``_PRODUCT_IMPORT_RE`` and ``_MINT_VERB_RE``): ``from
#:   kiro_crew.dashboard.token_auth import generate_token``, ``from kiro_crew.cli_server import
#:   _token``, the attribute route ``import kiro_crew.slack.gateway as g; g.generate_token(...)``
#:   -- a module that merely re-exports the producer under a path with no ``token`` in it --
#:   and the SECOND credential, the internal secret ``/api/token/local`` accepts: ``from
#:   kiro_crew.config.loader import read_local_secret`` reads ``.local_secret`` through product
#:   code, past the sensitive-path floor that fences the file itself. Every function that can
#:   produce a token carries ``token`` (``generate_token``, ``_token``, ``mint_remote_token``)
#:   and every reader of the internal secret carries ``secret`` (``read_local_secret``,
#:   ``read_secret``, ``_internal_secret``); ``test_the_mint_surface_covers_every_token_producer_
#:   in_the_tree`` and ``test_the_credential_word_covers_every_local_secret_reader_in_the_tree``
#:   derive both sets from the tree rather than from a hand-written list. Without a product
#:   import the word is a mention: ``print("kirocrew docs mention token")`` and
#:   ``re.search(r"kirocrew.*token", s)`` stay allowed, and a subprocess sink spelling the shell mint
#:   (``subprocess.run(["kirocrew", "token"])``) belongs to the interpreter-argv companion
#:   rule, which owns sink detection.
#:
#: A payload that imports some OTHER product module (``from kiro_crew.acp import x``) runs
#: product code, but it cannot reach the mint without ALSO spelling one of these -- or
#: handing the bare package name to a DYNAMIC module runner (``_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_RE``):
#: ``runpy.run_module('kiro_crew', run_name='__main__')`` is ``python -m kiro_crew`` spelled
#: without the dotted surface, and ``__import__('kiro_crew')`` reaches the same dispatch by
#: attribute. A reach that hides the name from all of these (built at run time from pieces
#: none of ``_fold_inline_literals`` / ``_decoded_b64_literals`` resolve) falls to the
#: residual the sensitive-path floor over the signing key covers.
