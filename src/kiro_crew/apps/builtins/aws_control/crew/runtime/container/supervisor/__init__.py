"""Track S3: launch the Kiro Crew backend headless and supervise the process tree.

This package owns the container entrypoint. It runs the startup order the
contract makes a correctness requirement (`container/CONTRACT.md`, "Startup
order"): gate the environment and install the bundle, then the backend, then the
front process. It also owns shutdown, which terminates process *groups* rather
than pids because a `kiro-cli` worker is a two-process tree and signalling only
the launcher orphans a child that finishes its turn anyway.

There is no restore phase and no sidecar: the backup subsystem was extracted from
this PR (durability is tracked separately).

Public seams other tracks may call (do not import our internals otherwise):

- ``container.supervisor.backend:start_backend(settings)``
- ``container.supervisor.backend:wait_until_ready(settings, timeout)``
