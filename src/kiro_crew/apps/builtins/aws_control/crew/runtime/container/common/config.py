"""Environment contract for the three container processes.

Every process in the task reads its configuration from here and nowhere else.
Parsing happens once, at import of `load()`, and the result is frozen: a process
that disagrees with another about a path or a port is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent.

Two values are deliberately NOT configurable.

`BACKEND_HOST` is fixed at 127.0.0.1. The Kiro Crew backend must never be
reachable from the network, and a setting is a thing an operator can get wrong.

The backend's authentication secret is not here either. It is generated per boot
and is read from disk on every use; see `secret.py`.
