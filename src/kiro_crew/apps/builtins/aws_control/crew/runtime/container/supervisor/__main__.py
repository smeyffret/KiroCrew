"""Container entrypoint: order the task, supervise it, drain it on shutdown.

Run as ``python -m container.supervisor``. This is the task's init process. It
does not serve anything itself; it enforces the startup order the contract makes
a correctness requirement and then supervises the children.

The order (``container/CONTRACT.md``, "Startup order"):

1. Gate the environment (layout, model credential, sandbox) and install the crew
   bundle. Nothing has started.
2. The backend starts and ``wait_until_ready`` returns (port answers AND the
   boot secret exists).
3. The front process starts.

There is no restore phase and no sidecar: the backup subsystem was extracted from
this PR (durability is tracked separately). When it returns it must reinstate the
rule that made it correct -- restore to completion before the backend starts, or
the backend's periodic flush persists an empty slot table over the gap.

Shutdown drains process groups, not pids (see ``process.py``): a ``kiro-cli``
worker is a two-process tree and signalling only the launcher orphans a child
that finishes its turn. Teardown order is front, then backend: stop new turns
arriving first, then let the backend drain in-flight work and flush to disk.
Anything still alive after the backend is gone is an escaped worker it could not
reap, so the teardown sweeps orphaned process groups directly.

Track boundaries: the front ``__main__`` seam is imported by its documented path,
lazily, so this module stays importable and testable and never reimplements the
other track's work.
