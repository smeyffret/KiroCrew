"""Release-channel worktrees: one detached checkout per published lane.

Dev Fleet manages git checkouts, and a git checkout has no release channel —
``platform/update_capability.py`` says so outright: *"Only the wheel command
carries a channel. A git checkout follows its remote."* That is fine for the
install the user runs, and useless for the question this module answers: **what
did stable actually ship, and can I click through it right now?**

WHY A WORKTREE PER LANE, AND NOT A PIN ON THE PRIMARY CHECKOUT. Sync
fast-forwards the primary checkout (``git merge --ff-only``) and refuses to run
unless HEAD is literally :data:`repository.BASE_BRANCH`. A stable tag is
normally BEHIND main, so pinning that checkout to a lane could only work by
detaching its HEAD (which the sync guard rejects, and every ``origin/main``
comparison on the fleet row is then measuring against a ref the user did not
choose) or by resetting ``main`` backwards, which destroys work. So the lane
gets its own detached worktree instead: additive, non-destructive, and it lands
in the fleet as an ordinary row that pods and Make Live already know how to
drive.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It never reads or writes ``$KIROCREW_HOME/channel``.
That file says which lane the user's real install FOLLOWS for updates; a pin
here says which git ref a worktree SITS ON. Coupling them would mean
materializing a stable worktree silently changed what the user's live install
downloads next — a blast radius nobody asked for. The only thing borrowed from
the update stack is vocabulary and validation.

Resolution is deliberately split from mutation: everything here is a read, so
the fleet snapshot can resolve every lane on its refresh path without any risk
of moving a worktree. The create/advance mutations live in ``worktree_ops``
beside the other worktree writers, because they take the same ``.git`` admin
lock those do.

    ADDITIVE, and deliberately so: a tag deleted upstream (a retracted release)
