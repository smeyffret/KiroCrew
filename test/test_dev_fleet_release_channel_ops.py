"""Create/advance of a release-channel worktree, and how the fleet publishes it.

Two classes of defect are guarded here, both of which produce a tree that looks
healthy:

* **Resolving stale.** ``create`` / ``advance`` must fetch BEFORE resolving. The
  background refresher keeps the fleet ROWS current, but it runs on its own
  schedule — a mutation that resolved first would pin whatever tags happened to be
  local at that moment and report the result as the channel tip.
* **Adopting a tree that is not ours.** ``release-channel-stable`` is a reserved
  name, and a user's own branch checkout under that name must never have its HEAD
  moved. Adoption requires the SHAPE (detached), never the name.
